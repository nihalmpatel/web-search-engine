Gregory Shamus / Getty Images Share Adjust Comment Print Justin Fields passed for 302 yards and four touchdowns, J.K. Dobbins rushed for a career-high 211 yards and four scores, and top-ranked Ohio State defeated No. 13 Michigan for the eighth consecutive time with a 56-27 win in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Saturday. Garrett Wilson caught three passes for 118 yards and a touchdown for Ohio State (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten), which has beaten Michigan in 15 of the past 16 meetings. Shea Patterson completed 18 of 43 passes for 305 yards and one touchdown for the 13th-ranked Wolverines (9-3, 6-3). Ohio State led 28-16 at halftime and opened the second half with another touchdown drive. K.J. Hill caught a 6-yard pass from Fields to complete it, making the score 35-16. Fields left the game briefly due to a knee injury. Upon his return, he fired a 30-yard touchdown pass to Wilson with 3:46 left in the third. Michigan’s Quinn Nordin kicked a 45-yard field goal before the quarter ended. Hassan Haskins’ 2-yard run in the opening minute of the fourth, plus a two-point conversion, cut Ohio State’s lead to 42-27. After the Wolverines failed on a fourth-down conversion, Fields hit Austin Mack on a 16-yard touchdown pass. Dobbins scored on a 33-yard run with 6:30 remaining for the final points. Freshman Giles Jackson scored on an end around from 22 yards out to give Michigan an early lead. Nordin missed the extra point. A 28-yard completion from Fields to Dobbins set up Ohio State’s first score, a 5-yard run by Dobbins, for a 7-6 lead with 8:50 left in the first quarter. With 1:27 remaining in the quarter, Chris Olave beat one-on-one coverage along the right sideline and hauled in a long pass by Fields. That 57-yard pass play made it 14-6. The Wolverines came right back with a 25-yard scoring pass from Patterson to Donovan Peoples-Jones. That was set up by a 41-yard pass to Sean McKeon. A 41-yard pass from Fields to Wilson highlighted the Buckeyes’ next scoring drive, which Dobbins finished with a 6-yard run to put Ohio State up 21-13. An offside penalty against Michigan on fourth down extended the Buckeyes’ next drive. They took advantage with a 5-yard scoring run by Dobbins. Wilson had a 47-yard reception one play before the touchdown. Nordin kicked a 23-yard field goal with 19 seconds left in the half. –Field Level Media No. 2 Michigan State beats Wisconsin, wraps up Big Ten title This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
