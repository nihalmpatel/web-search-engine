WRCB Radar 4+ WRCB-TV 2.7, 52 Ratings Free Screenshots iPhone iPad Description The best weather app in the Tennessee Valley gets even better! You spoke, and we've listened. Channel 3 knows that weather plays an important role in your life. It determines the route you take to work, how you make plans for the weekend and if the kids will have soccer practice. We've worked closely with our app development team to re-vamp the WRCB Radar app. Current conditions, with information generated by the Channel 3 Storm Alert Team, gives you a quick glimpse into what's going on outside right now. By scrolling down you can find conditions for the week ahead, our Live Stream, School Closings and new Traffic/Road Conditions. The new, high-resolution radar now has Storm Tracks, so you can tell if the storm is headed your way, and what areas around you may be affected. Be sure to turn on Alerts to be warned of dangerous weather in your locations. You'll be notified by our team of meteorologists and be prepared. What‚Äôs New Version History Nov 13, 2019 Version 4.10.1602 * performance improvements Ratings and Reviews 2.7 out of 5 52 Ratings 52 Ratings bartman40 , 08/13/2019 Good, but needs a update Your weather app is nice, but it needs a update. When you look at the radar. And it‚Äôs raining but on the radar it shows nothing. Fix this. HeatherLandry , 05/15/2019 üåà ‚õÖÔ∏è Yep ‚òÄÔ∏è‚õà I like the app. Great radar! Only two things I want to mention. 1. Why does the radar clock use military time? At least make it optional. I find the 24 hour clock confusing. 2. The app sometimes loses its connection when you leave it for a while, which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, except that you can‚Äôt close the pop-up connection-error box, so you‚Äôre forced to restart the app. So just add an exit to that error screen. Other than that, I‚Äôm enjoying the app and it has quickly become my go-to for weather, especially for your radar. I like having the earlier/now/later all in one place. Stephanie.plum , 05/04/2018 Older was better!!!! I am removing from my phone. I need weather at a glance. You old app did that and did it well. I purposely didn‚Äôt update because my wife told me how bad it was. Well the old app no longer works and I updated only to be disappointed. I should be able to look at the radar, current temp, maybe a couple 3 day forecast and if I want hourly or seven day just click a button. Very disappointed that the app go worse.
