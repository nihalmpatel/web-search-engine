Fiat Chrysler is recalling more than 10,600 older Fiat 500 cars in Canada over a transmission issue that could pose a rollaway risk. Some 10,627 cars from model-year 2012 and 2013 are part of the campaign, which covers a total 72,761 cars globally. On affected vehicles, shift cable bushings could degrade prematurely due to heat and humidity, separating the shift cable from the transmission and keep it from shifting into the selected gear; that means in PARK, the vehicle could roll away. In fact, FCA is aware of “three minor accidents” potentially related to the issue, though none resulted in any injury. Customers should be wary if they notice loose shifter movement, but as a precaution should always select the parking brake gear.
