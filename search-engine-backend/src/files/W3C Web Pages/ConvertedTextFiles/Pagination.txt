The API endpoints default to providing a limited number of items per request, the same way that a WordPress site will default to 10 posts per page in archive views. Pagination Parameters #Pagination Parameters Any API response which contains multiple resources supports several common query parameters to handle paging through the response data: ?page=: specify the page of results to return. For example, /wp/v2/posts?page=2 is the second page of posts results By retrieving /wp/v2/posts, then /wp/v2/posts?page=2, and so on, you may access every available post through the API, one page at a time. ?per_page=: specify the number of records to return in one request, specified as an integer from 1 to 100. For example, /wp/v2/posts?per_page=1 will return only the first post in the collection ?offset=: specify an arbitrary offset at which to start retrieving posts For example, /wp/v2/posts?offset=6 will use the default number of posts per page, but start at the 6th post in the collection ?per_page=5&page=4 is equivalent to ?per_page=5&offset=15 Tip: Large queries can hurt site performance, so per_page is capped at 100 records. If you wish to retrieve more than 100 records, for example to build a client-side list of all available categories, you may make multiple API requests and combine the results within your application. To determine how many pages of data are available, the API returns two header fields with every paginated response: X-WP-Total: the total number of records in the collection X-WP-TotalPages: the total number of pages encompassing all available records By inspecting these header fields you can determine how much more data is available within the API. Top ↑ Ordering Results #Ordering Results In addition to the pagination query parameters detailed above, several other parameters control the order of the returned results: ?order=: control whether results are returned in ascending or descending order Valid values are ?order=asc (for ascending order) and ?order=desc (for descending order). All native collections are returned in descending order by default. ?orderby=: control the field by which the collection is sorted The valid values for orderby will vary depending on the queried resource; for the /wp/v2/posts collection, the valid values are “date,” “relevance,” “id,” “include,” “title,” and “slug” See the REST API reference for the values supported by other collections All collections with dated resources default to orderby=date   Handbook navigation ← Global Parameters Linking and Embedding → About Blog Hosting Donate Support Developers Get Involved Showcase Plugins Themes WordCamp WordPress.TV BuddyPress bbPress WordPress.com Matt Privacy Public Code @WordPress WordPress Code is Poetry.
