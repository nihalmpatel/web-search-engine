Now they've got to discover it on the road. The Kings open their December slate at Anaheim on Monday night, with a chance to pull even with the rival Ducks in the Pacific Division standings. Los Angeles (11-14-2) went 7-1-1 at home last month in its bid to escape the division cellar. That included a 2-1 victory against Winnipeg on Saturday night, as Joakim Ryan and Nikolai Prokhorkin each scored, and goaltender Jack Campbell made 33 saves.   MORE Kings Headlines Kings looking to drag Ducks into basement with them Kings cool Jets' November roll with 2-1 win Martin Jones makes 33 saves, Sharks beat Kings 4-1 Kings beat Islanders 4-1 behind 24 saves from surging Quick Kings' Alec Martinez has surgery on wrist cut by skate Marleau scores in OT, surging Sharks top Kings 4-3 Crouse scores, leaves with injury as Coyotes beat Kings Kings pick apart Oilers' top line 5-1 to stay hot at home Garland, Raanta lead Coyotes to 3-0 win over Kings Carter gets winner in 1,000th game, Kings top Golden Knights Leaders Points: A.
