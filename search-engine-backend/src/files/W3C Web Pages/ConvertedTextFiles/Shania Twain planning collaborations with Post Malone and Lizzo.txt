The Still The One singer, who closed Sunday night’s American Music Awards with a hits medley, admits she was blown away by the talent onstage and now she wants to work with a handful of the winners and nominees. First up, will be Post Malone, who Shania championed before anyone knew who he was, meeting up with the tattooed rapper backstage at one of his early shows and offering up encouragement. “I’ve written a song for us already,” she tells The Talk. “He doesn’t know it yet. He knows now. So Post, I have a song for us.” Shania is also planning a collaboration with huge fan Lizzo after meeting up with her and Janelle Monae over the summer. “There’s a really cool friendship starting between us…,” she adds. “We got up onstage… I kinda, like, hold them up there, being kinda mama bear. I’ve actually wrote a song for the three of us (sic). It’s called Sisters… They don’t know about it yet.” Twain is also hoping to hit the recording studio with Harry Styles, adding, “We’ve been back and forth already about collaborating on a song… We love each other, we’re fans of each other, so we’ll find the right song and we’ll get into the studio and do it.” Related 'GIRL POWER': Shania Twain thrilled by Canadian women's soccer team song tribute Shania Twain signs on for Jeremy Camp biopic 'I Still Believe' STARSTRUCK: Shania Twain was 'awkward' when she first met Madonna All-local music project offers 10 songs for Windsor's 10 wards This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
