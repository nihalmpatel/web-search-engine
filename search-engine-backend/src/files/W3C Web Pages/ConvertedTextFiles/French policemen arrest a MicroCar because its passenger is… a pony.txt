She couldn't move the horse in a van since she didn't have a licence by Nadine FilionÂ  Â |Â November 28, 2019 SHARE STORY French policemen from Sud de la France were conducting a distracted driving crackdown near Marseille last week when they spotted surely the strangest thing theyâ€™ll see in their career: a goddamn pony riding shotgun in a microcar. They snapped the photo you see above, then they arrested the woman driving the vehicle, only to discover she also didnâ€™t have a driverâ€™s licence. Luckily, behind the wheel of a microcar like this, thatâ€™s not a problem: in France, as long as youâ€™re over 14 years old, you can drive said voitures sans permis on almost any road, except expressways and highways. And anyway, you donâ€™t want to ride those citadines anywhere but cities or on quiet regional roads, since theyâ€™re legally limited to 45 km/h.

Noble cause certes mais attention aux rÃ¨gles de transport de nos amis les #Animaux pic.twitter.com/tJoZNFmRAUâ€” Police nationale 13 (@PoliceNat13) November 22, 2019 The problem here was more the, uh, animal. As Police Nationale 13 told the media after the bizarre event, there are rules for keeping our four-legged friends safe in an automobile. In this case, they were obviously not respected. To be fair, the horse seems like it was treated humanely, as its owner explained to the officers. First, wood planks on the floor gave it space to stretch comfortably. And while the pony got into the car from the trunk, once they got to their destination â€“ a center for handicapped children â€“ heâ€™d exit via the passenger door.

Police officers checked her story and found she was telling the truth â€” so they let her go. No fine was issued. But, boy, did those cops have a story to tell.
