What is NIE? Newspapers In Education (NIE) is an international program that began in 1955 to advance the use of newspapers in schools as a learning resource in the classroom. The StarPhoenix NIE program is a partnership between our local schools, the community and the newspaper. Thanks to our contributors we are able to provide newspapers to schools to use as a learning tool in the classroom at little to no cost. Our goal is to provide an interactive resource tool, a "living textbook," that can enhance lessons by offering students and teachers fresh resources every day. Newspapers make great educational tools because they are current, fun to use, and contain reading material of interest to everyone. The newspaper connects students to their community, province and the world. Click here to learn more about our NIE options.

Newspapers in the classroom help make teaching more creative and challenging. Newspapers contain something for every student: real math problems, science as it happens, editorials on current topics, local news, entertainment highlights, classified ads and more. Newspapers enhance classroom projects and promote cooperative team efforts. Comment on articles to become part of the conversation. Newspapers have transfer effects – students learn from newspapers at school and convey their knowledge at home. Newspapers contribute to independent reading, improved vocabulary, enhanced comprehension, critical thinking and improved reading and writing skills. Newspapers are "living" textbooks, reporting history as it happens, while creating interest in current events. Newspapers bridge the gap between the classroom and the "real" world. Newspapers are motivational, lots of fun, and increase local and international awareness. NIE - Parents Parents Some helpful hints to help kids learn at home using the newspaper: Read the newspaper regularly. Talk about what you are reading. Read aloud to your children. Read together. Let children choose what they want to read. Set a good example. When a child sees their parents reading the newspaper, they are more likely to become newspaper readers as well. Point out the practical application of what they have read and learned. For example, if they read about an article on food safety, this can be applied when buying groceries. Try a variety of activities with the newspaper - reading, talking, writing, or just simply looking through the newspaper together. Scale down the newspaper for young children - use one section at a time. Make the activities short and fun. If children show no interest, try again another day. Relax - learning with the newspaper should be and can be fun. Only your imagination can set limits to what you can do with the newspaper.
