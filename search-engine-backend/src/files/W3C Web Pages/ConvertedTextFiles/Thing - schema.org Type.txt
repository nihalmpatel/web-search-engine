Thing - schema.org Type schema.org Documentation Schemas Home Thing Thing The most generic type of item. [more...] Canonical URL: http://schema.org/Thing Leave public feedback on this term ðŸ’¬ Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from Thing additionalType URLÂ  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName TextÂ  An alias for the item. description TextÂ  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription TextÂ  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValueÂ  or TextÂ  or URLÂ  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObjectÂ  or URLÂ  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWorkÂ  or URLÂ  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name TextÂ  The name of the item. potentialAction ActionÂ  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URLÂ  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWorkÂ  or EventÂ  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URLÂ  URL of the item. Instances of Thing may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description about CommunicateActionÂ  or CreativeWorkÂ  or EventÂ  The subject matter of the content. inverse property: subjectOf. actionOption ChooseActionÂ  A sub property of object. The options subject to this action. Supersedes, option. category ActionAccessSpecificationÂ  or InvoiceÂ  or OfferÂ  or PhysicalActivityÂ  or ProductÂ  or ServiceÂ  A category for the item. Greater signs or slashes can be used to informally indicate a category hierarchy. characterAttribute GameÂ  or VideoGameSeriesÂ  A piece of data that represents a particular aspect of a fictional character (skill, power, character points, advantage, disadvantage). dataFeedElement DataFeedÂ  An item within in a data feed. Data feeds may have many elements. defaultValue PropertyValueSpecificationÂ  The default value of the input. For properties that expect a literal, the default is a literal value, for properties that expect an object, it's an ID reference to one of the current values. error ActionÂ  For failed actions, more information on the cause of the failure. fundedItem GrantÂ  Indicates an item funded or sponsored through a Grant. gameItem GameÂ  or VideoGameSeriesÂ  An item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character. gamePlatform VideoGameÂ  or VideoGameSeriesÂ  The electronic systems used to play video games. instrument ActionÂ  The object that helped the agent perform the action. e.g. John wrote a book with a pen. item DataFeedItemÂ  or ListItemÂ  An entity represented by an entry in a list or data feed (e.g. an 'artist' in a list of 'artists')â€™. itemListElement ItemListÂ  For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g. "Peter", "Paul", "Mary"), existing entities, or use ListItem. Text values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists. Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements. Use ListItem with a 'position' property in such cases. itemReviewed AggregateRatingÂ  or ReviewÂ  The item that is being reviewed/rated. knowsAbout OrganizationÂ  or PersonÂ  Of a Person, and less typically of an Organization, to indicate a topic that is known about - suggesting possible expertise but not implying it.

Also known as the semantic roles patient, affected or undergoer (which change their state) or theme (which doesn't). e.g. John read a book. purpose AllocateActionÂ  or MedicalDeviceÂ  or PayActionÂ  A goal towards an action is taken.
