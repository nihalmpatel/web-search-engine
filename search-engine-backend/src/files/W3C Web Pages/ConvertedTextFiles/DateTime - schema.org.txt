For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g. John wrote a book from January to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file. Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions. exceptDate ScheduleÂ  Defines a Date or DateTime during which a scheduled Event will not take place. The property allows exceptions to a Schedule to be specified. If an exception is specified as a DateTime then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a Date then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event. expectedArrivalFrom ParcelDeliveryÂ  The earliest date the package may arrive. expectedArrivalUntil ParcelDeliveryÂ  The latest date the package may arrive. marginOfError ObservationÂ  A marginOfError for an Observation. modifiedTime ReservationÂ  The date and time the reservation was modified. observationDate ObservationÂ  The observationDate of an Observation. orderDate OrderÂ  Date order was placed. ownedFrom OwnershipInfoÂ  The date and time of obtaining the product. ownedThrough OwnershipInfoÂ  The date and time of giving up ownership on the product. paymentDueDate InvoiceÂ  or OrderÂ  The date that payment is due.

For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. e.g. John wrote a book from January to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip within a larger file. Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions. temporal CreativeWorkÂ  The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage CreativeWorkÂ  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945". Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes, datasetTimeInterval. validFrom DemandÂ  or LocationFeatureSpecificationÂ  or MonetaryAmountÂ  or OfferÂ  or OpeningHoursSpecificationÂ  or PermitÂ  or PriceSpecificationÂ  The date when the item becomes valid. validThrough DemandÂ  or JobPostingÂ  or LocationFeatureSpecificationÂ  or MonetaryAmountÂ  or OfferÂ  or OpeningHoursSpecificationÂ  or PriceSpecificationÂ  The date after when the item is not valid. For example the end of an offer, salary period, or a period of opening hours. webCheckinTime FlightÂ  The time when a passenger can check into the flight online.
