When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event  The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent  The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review  A review of the item.

Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork  or URL  A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization  or Person  Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization  The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place  The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place  The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization  or Person  A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. temporal DateTime  or Text  The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime  or Text  or URL  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945". Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text  The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL  A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration  Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork  The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization  or Person  Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text  The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. version Number  or Text  The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip  or VideoObject  An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork  Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork  A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text  An alias for the item. description Text  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue  or Text  or URL  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject  or URL  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork  or URL  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text  The name of the item. potentialAction Action  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork  or Event  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL  URL of the item. Instances of MusicRecording may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description recordedAs MusicComposition  An audio recording of the work. inverse property: recordingOf. track MusicGroup  or MusicPlaylist  A music recording (track)—usually a single song. If an ItemList is given, the list should contain items of type MusicRecording. Supersedes, tracks. Examples Example 1 Without Markup Microdata RDFa JSON-LD <h1>Foo Fighters</h1>
