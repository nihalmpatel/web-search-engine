Hearing the clock begin to run on the Taylor Hall Era was even worse. The Devils will look to bounce back from one of their most discouraging days of the season - and perhaps begin doing their best to convince Hall to remain with the team - when they visit the Buffalo Sabres on Monday night in an Eastern Conference battle. Both teams were off Sunday after absorbing losses Saturday, when the host Devils were blanked by the New York Rangers, 4-0, and the visiting Sabres completed a back-to-back set against the Toronto Maple Leafs by falling, 2-1, in overtime.   MORE Sabres Headlines Sabres look to extend recent spurt against beleaguered Devils Tavares scores in OT, leads Maple Leafs past Sabres 2-1 Eichel scores twice, Sabres outlast Maple Leafs 6-4 Lindholm scores in OT, Flames beat Sabres 3-2 Sabres defenseman Dahlin out indefinitely with concussion Lightning get 2 short-handed goals, beat Sabres 5-2 Girgensons, Eichel lead Sabres over Panthers, 5-2 Marchand, Pastrnak lead Bruins past Sabres 3-2 Parise scores 2 goals, Wild beat Sabres 4-1 Sabres GM Botterill 'actively seeking' forward depth Leaders Points: J.
