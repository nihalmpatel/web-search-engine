Music director Robert Franz will conduct the performance that features the full orchestra, four soloists and the 75-voice Windsor Symphony Orchestra Chorus conducted by chorus master Bruce Kotowich. The soloists include soprano Katy Clark, mezzo-soprano Sophie Roland, tenor Matt Chittick and bass Christopher Dunham. The concert is hosted by St. Andrew’s United Church. The church has brought the symphony to Chatham several times but has never held the performance at the Chatham Armoury. “Messiah, written as an oratorio for Easter and Lent, is now closely associated with Christmas,” the news release said. “The work has become the most performed and recorded choral piece in North America. The program includes ‘Ev’ry valley shall be exalted,’ ‘For unto us a child is born,’ the famous ‘Hallelujah’ chorus, and more.” Tickets are available at St. Andrew’s Monday to Friday during the weeks of Nov. 25 and Dec. 2 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets are $30 in advance or $35 at the door. Students are free. Doors open at 6:45 p.m. and a cash bar is available. The symphony will also perform in Chatham on Feb. 14 and April 24. Tickets for all three concerts can be purchased for $75 before Dec. 6.
