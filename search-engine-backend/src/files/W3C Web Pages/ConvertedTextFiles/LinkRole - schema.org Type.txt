LinkRole - schema.org Type schema.org Documentation Schemas Home LinkRole This term is proposed for full integration into Schema.org, pending implementation feedback and adoption from applications and websites. Thing > Intangible > Role > LinkRole A Role that represents a Web link e.g. as expressed via the 'url' property. Its linkRelationship property can indicate URL-based and plain textual link types e.g. those in IANA link registry or others such as 'amphtml'. This structure provides a placeholder where details from HTML's link element can be represented outside of HTML, e.g. in JSON-LD feeds.

Properties from Role endDate DateÂ  or DateTimeÂ  The end date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format). roleName TextÂ  or URLÂ  A role played, performed or filled by a person or organization.

Supersedes namedPosition. startDate DateÂ  or DateTimeÂ  The start date and time of the item (in ISO 8601 date format). Properties from Thing additionalType URLÂ  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName TextÂ  An alias for the item. description TextÂ  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription TextÂ  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValueÂ  or TextÂ  or URLÂ  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObjectÂ  or URLÂ  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWorkÂ  or URLÂ  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name TextÂ  The name of the item. potentialAction ActionÂ  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URLÂ  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWorkÂ  or EventÂ  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing.
