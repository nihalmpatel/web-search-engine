The actor is offering up the Cleveland Indians cap he wore in the movie as baseball star Ricky ‘Wild Thing’ Vaughn, as well as the ball he used to strike out his onscreen nemesis. Both props were kept by Sheen as mementos from the shoot, but he’s now recruited auctioneers at Lelands to find new homes for the items, which will remain on sale until Friday. “It is my hope that whoever buys the cap and ball will get as much enjoyment from them as I did all these years,” Sheen told the New York Post’s Page Six. “Whenever people would come over to my house, they always asked about trying on the cap.” He is also offloading a watch he wore in Platoon, and other pieces from his personal collection, including baseball legend Babe Ruth’s locker tag, and a signed copy of Ernest Hemingway novel The Old Man and the Sea.
