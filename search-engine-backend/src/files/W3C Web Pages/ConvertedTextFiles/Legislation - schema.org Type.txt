Property Expected Type Description Properties from Legislation legislationApplies Legislation  Indicates that this legislation (or part of a legislation) somehow transfers another legislation in a different legislative context. This is an informative link, and it has no legal value. For legally-binding links of transposition, use the legislationTransposes property. For example an informative consolidated law of a European Union's member state "applies" the consolidated version of the European Directive implemented in it. legislationChanges Legislation  Another legislation that this legislation changes. This encompasses the notions of amendment, replacement, correction, repeal, or other types of change. This may be a direct change (textual or non-textual amendment) or a consequential or indirect change. The property is to be used to express the existence of a change relationship between two acts rather than the existence of a consolidated version of the text that shows the result of the change. For consolidation relationships, use the legislationConsolidates property. legislationConsolidates Legislation  Indicates another legislation taken into account in this consolidated legislation (which is usually the product of an editorial process that revises the legislation). This property should be used multiple times to refer to both the original version or the previous consolidated version, and to the legislations making the change. legislationDate Date  The date of adoption or signature of the legislation. This is the date at which the text is officially aknowledged to be a legislation, even though it might not even be published or in force. legislationDateVersion Date  The point-in-time at which the provided description of the legislation is valid (e.g. : when looking at the law on the 2016-04-07 (= dateVersion), I get the consolidation of 2015-04-12 of the "National Insurance Contributions Act 2015") legislationIdentifier Text  or URL  An identifier for the legislation. This can be either a string-based identifier, like the CELEX at EU level or the NOR in France, or a web-based, URL/URI identifier, like an ELI (European Legislation Identifier) or an URN-Lex. legislationJurisdiction AdministrativeArea  or Text  The jurisdiction from which the legislation originates. legislationLegalForce LegalForceStatus  Whether the legislation is currently in force, not in force, or partially in force. legislationPassedBy Organization  or Person  The person or organization that originally passed or made the law : typically parliament (for primary legislation) or government (for secondary legislation). This indicates the "legal author" of the law, as opposed to its physical author. legislationResponsible Organization  or Person  An individual or organization that has some kind of responsibility for the legislation. Typically the ministry who is/was in charge of elaborating the legislation, or the adressee for potential questions about the legislation once it is published. legislationTransposes Legislation  Indicates that this legislation (or part of legislation) fulfills the objectives set by another legislation, by passing appropriate implementation measures. Typically, some legislations of European Union's member states or regions transpose European Directives. This indicates a legally binding link between the 2 legislations. legislationType CategoryCode  or Text  The type of the legislation. Examples of values are "law", "act", "directive", "decree", "regulation", "statutory instrument", "loi organique", "règlement grand-ducal", etc., depending on the country.

When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. recordedAt Event  The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event. Inverse property: recordedIn. releasedEvent PublicationEvent  The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. review Review  A review of the item.

Typically used alongside sdPublisher sdLicense CreativeWork  or URL  A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. sdPublisher Organization  or Person  Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization  The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place  The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place  The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization  or Person  A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. temporal DateTime  or Text  The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime  or Text  or URL  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945". Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text  The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL  A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration  Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork  The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization  or Person  Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text  The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. version Number  or Text  The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip  or VideoObject  An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork  Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg. The paperback edition, first edition, or eBook. Inverse property: exampleOfWork. workTranslation CreativeWork  A work that is a translation of the content of this work. e.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”,a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo. Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text  An alias for the item. description Text  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue  or Text  or URL  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObject  or URL  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWork  or URL  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described.

Inverse property: mainEntity. name Text  The name of the item. potentialAction Action  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWork  or Event  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URL  URL of the item. Instances of Legislation may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description legislationApplies Legislation  Indicates that this legislation (or part of a legislation) somehow transfers another legislation in a different legislative context. This is an informative link, and it has no legal value. For legally-binding links of transposition, use the legislationTransposes property. For example an informative consolidated law of a European Union's member state "applies" the consolidated version of the European Directive implemented in it. legislationChanges Legislation  Another legislation that this legislation changes. This encompasses the notions of amendment, replacement, correction, repeal, or other types of change. This may be a direct change (textual or non-textual amendment) or a consequential or indirect change. The property is to be used to express the existence of a change relationship between two acts rather than the existence of a consolidated version of the text that shows the result of the change. For consolidation relationships, use the legislationConsolidates property. legislationConsolidates Legislation  Indicates another legislation taken into account in this consolidated legislation (which is usually the product of an editorial process that revises the legislation). This property should be used multiple times to refer to both the original version or the previous consolidated version, and to the legislations making the change. legislationTransposes Legislation  Indicates that this legislation (or part of legislation) fulfills the objectives set by another legislation, by passing appropriate implementation measures. Typically, some legislations of European Union's member states or regions transpose European Directives. This indicates a legally binding link between the 2 legislations.
