Search types are handled by extending WP_REST_Search_Handler, and the active search type may be filtered using the wp_rest_search_handlers filter. #39965 Introduce wp/v2/blocks route to retrieve individual reusable blocks. Requires authentication. #45098 Introduce autosaves endpoints for all post types except attachment. Autosaves endpoints utilize the new WP_REST_Autosaves_Controller class, and saves only the id, title, post_content and excerpt for a post. Autosaves are enabled even for post types which do not support revisions. Requires authentication. #43316 Introduce wp/v2/block-renderer/<name> routes to return dynamically generated markup for server-rendered blocks. The name component of the URL is structured as namespace/block-id, e.g. core/archives. Requires authentication. #45098 Introduce wp/v2/themes endpoint to expose supported theme features to the block editor. This endpoint only returns data for the active theme. Requires authentication. #45016 Introduce wp/v2/types/wp_block endpoint to expose block labels and capabilities relating to the new hidden post type wp_block. #45098 Additional Changes Custom taxonomies must specify show_in_rest as true to be visible in the block editor. Introduce wp_is_json_request() function to detemine if request is expecting a JSON response, and contextually silence PHP warnings if so. r43730 Requests to public, viewable post types specifying the edit context now return two additional properties, permalink_temlate and generated_slug. r43720 Respect the ?_fields= filter when applying custom post properties with register_rest_field. r43736 Permit users with read_private_posts capability to query for private posts. r43694 Declare the unfiltered_html capability using JSON Hyper Schema targetSchema. r43682 Introduce block_version property on the post object to denote the presence and version of blocks within the post. r43770 Add new rest_after_* action hooks that fire after all write operations have completed. r42864 See The REST API in WordPress 5.0 for further commentary. Top ↑ Version 4.9.8 #Version 4.9.8 Introduce ?_fields= global query parameter to limit the properties included in response objects to a specified subset. #38131 Add an object_subtype argument to the $args parameter for register_meta(): this parameter allows developers to specify the object subtypes (i.e. specific post types or taxonomies) for which the registered meta will appear when show_in_rest is true. Introduce new wrapper methods register_post_meta() and register_term_meta() which are recommended instead of register_meta when working with post or term meta. r43378 Top ↑ Version 4.8.1 #Version 4.8.1 Add a filter to allow modifying the response after embedded data is added. r41093 wp-api.js client: Correctly interpret settings resource as a model rather than a collection. r41126 Fix PUT (and other) requests for nginx servers by tweaking REST API URLs. r41140 Top ↑ Version 4.8.0 #Version 4.8.0 Improve strings added after 4.7.0 string freeze. r40571, r40606 Canonicalize header names in WP_REST_Request::remove_header(). r40577 Allow Origin: null from file: URLs. r40600 Set global $post variable when preparing revisions. r40601 Include featured_media in embed responses. r40602 Add author, modified, and parent sort order options for posts. r40605 Add endpoint for proxying requests to external oEmbed providers, and use it in the media modal instead of the parse-embed AJAX action.  This is the first usage of the WP REST API in wp-admin. r40628 Do not set X-WP-Deprecated* headers as often. r40782 Avoid sending blank Last-Modified headers with authenticated requests. r40805 Fix changing parameters with $request->set_param() for some requests. r40815 In the admin area, ensure the REST API endpoint URL is forced to https when necessary. r40843 Top ↑ Version 4.7.4 #Version 4.7.4 Fix another (DST-related) issue with dates of posts. r40325 Add gmt_offset and timezone_string to the base /wp-json response. r40336 Confirm that the parent post object of an attachment exists in WP_REST_Posts_Controller::check_read_permission(). r40337 Allow fetching multiple users and terms at once via the slug parameters of the respective endpoints. r40426, r40427 Top ↑ Version 4.7.3 #Version 4.7.3 Cast revision author ID to int. r40078 Correctly serve the index with PATH_INFO. r40079 Include the status property in view context responses from the Posts endpoints. r40081 wp-api.js client: Use _.extend instead of _.union when merging objects. r40084 To prepare for a full multisite implementation in 4.8, do not allow access to users from a different site. r40111 Correctly parse body parameters for DELETE requests. r40113 Fix multiple issues with dates of posts and comments. r40114, r40115 wp-api.js client: Fix route discovery for custom namespaces. r40117 Fix the behavior of the sticky posts filter when no posts are sticky. r40136 Allow setting all post formats even if they are not supported by the theme. r40137 Top ↑ Version 4.7.2 #Version 4.7.2 Unify object access handling for simplicity. r39957 Top ↑ Version 4.7.1 #Version 4.7.1 Treat any falsy value as false in 'rest_allow_anonymous_comments'. r39566 wp-api.js client: Fix setup of models used by wp.api.collections objects. r39604 Do not error on empty JSON body. r39609 Do not include the password argument for the GET /wp/v2/media endpoint. r39610 Allow sending empty or no-op comment updates. r39628 Add support for filename search in the GET /wp/v2/media endpoint. r39629 Fix PHP warnings when get_theme_support( 'post-formats' ) is not an array. r39630 Improve the rest_*_collection_params filter docs and fix the terms filter. r39631 Allow schema sanitization_callback to be set to null to bypass built-in sanitization. r39642 Change which users are shown in the users endpoint. r39844   Handbook navigation ← Search Results About Blog Hosting Donate Support Developers Get Involved Showcase Plugins Themes WordCamp WordPress.TV BuddyPress bbPress WordPress.com Matt Privacy Public Code @WordPress WordPress Code is Poetry.
