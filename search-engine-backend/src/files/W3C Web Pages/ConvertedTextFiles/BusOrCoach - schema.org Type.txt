Property Expected Type Description Properties from BusOrCoach acrissCode Text  The ACRISS Car Classification Code is a code used by many car rental companies, for classifying vehicles. ACRISS stands for Association of Car Rental Industry Systems and Standards. roofLoad QuantitativeValue  The permitted total weight of cargo and installations (e.g. a roof rack) on top of the vehicle. Typical unit code(s): KGM for kilogram, LBR for pound Note 1: You can indicate additional information in the name of the QuantitativeValue node. Note 2: You may also link to a QualitativeValue node that provides additional information using valueReference Note 3: Note that you can use minValue and maxValue to indicate ranges. Properties from Vehicle accelerationTime QuantitativeValue  The time needed to accelerate the vehicle from a given start velocity to a given target velocity. Typical unit code(s): SEC for seconds Note: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for seconds/0..100 km/h or seconds/0..60 mph. Simply use "SEC" for seconds and indicate the velocities in the name of the QuantitativeValue, or use valueReference with a QuantitativeValue of 0..60 mph or 0..100 km/h to specify the reference speeds. bodyType QualitativeValue  or Text  or URL  Indicates the design and body style of the vehicle (e.g. station wagon, hatchback, etc.). callSign Text  A callsign, as used in broadcasting and radio communications to identify people, radio and TV stations, or vehicles. cargoVolume QuantitativeValue  The available volume for cargo or luggage. For automobiles, this is usually the trunk volume. Typical unit code(s): LTR for liters, FTQ for cubic foot/feet Note: You can use minValue and maxValue to indicate ranges. dateVehicleFirstRegistered Date  The date of the first registration of the vehicle with the respective public authorities. driveWheelConfiguration DriveWheelConfigurationValue  or Text  The drive wheel configuration, i.e. which roadwheels will receive torque from the vehicle's engine via the drivetrain. emissionsCO2 Number  The CO2 emissions in g/km. When used in combination with a QuantitativeValue, put "g/km" into the unitText property of that value, since there is no UN/CEFACT Common Code for "g/km". fuelCapacity QuantitativeValue  The capacity of the fuel tank or in the case of electric cars, the battery. If there are multiple components for storage, this should indicate the total of all storage of the same type. Typical unit code(s): LTR for liters, GLL of US gallons, GLI for UK / imperial gallons, AMH for ampere-hours (for electrical vehicles). fuelConsumption QuantitativeValue  The amount of fuel consumed for traveling a particular distance or temporal duration with the given vehicle (e.g. liters per 100 km). Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for liters per 100 km. Use unitText to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. L/100 km. Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, fuelConsumption (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and fuelEfficiency (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal. Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed ("at 80 km/h") or usage pattern ("city traffic"). You can use valueReference to link the value for the fuel consumption to another value. fuelEfficiency QuantitativeValue  The distance traveled per unit of fuel used; most commonly miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/L). Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. Use unitText to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. mpg or km/L. Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, fuelConsumption (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and fuelEfficiency (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal. Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed ("at 80 km/h") or usage pattern ("city traffic"). You can use valueReference to link the value for the fuel economy to another value. fuelType QualitativeValue  or Text  or URL  The type of fuel suitable for the engine or engines of the vehicle.

GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes. The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties. The GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as URLs. A correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. gtin12 Text  The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit used to identify trade items. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. gtin13 Text  The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceeding zero. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. gtin14 Text  The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details. gtin8 Text  The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN.

Properties from Thing additionalType URL  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types.
