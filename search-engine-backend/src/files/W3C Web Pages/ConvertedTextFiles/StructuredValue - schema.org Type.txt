Property Expected Type Description Properties from Thing additionalType URLÂ  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName TextÂ  An alias for the item. description TextÂ  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription TextÂ  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValueÂ  or TextÂ  or URLÂ  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObjectÂ  or URLÂ  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWorkÂ  or URLÂ  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name TextÂ  The name of the item. potentialAction ActionÂ  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URLÂ  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWorkÂ  or EventÂ  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URLÂ  URL of the item. Instances of StructuredValue may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description value MonetaryAmountÂ  or PropertyValueÂ  or QuantitativeValueÂ  The value of the quantitative value or property value node. For QuantitativeValue and MonetaryAmount, the recommended type for values is 'Number'. For PropertyValue, it can be 'Text;', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'. Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols. Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator. valueReference PropertyValueÂ  or QualitativeValueÂ  or QuantitativeValueÂ  A pointer to a secondary value that provides additional information on the original value, e.g. a reference temperature.
