Ratings and Reviews 4.7 out of 5 708.5K Ratings 708.5K Ratings King of Rancho Cucamonga , 07/09/2018 Terribly slow and contradicting It‚Äôs horribly slow to load any new info without jumping through hoops. Start switching cities, close out of it completely to name a couple and the radar is spotty at best. What I mean is huge chunks of the radar image are missing, conveniently it‚Äôs usually missing around the area I‚Äôm trying to look at. Does me no good if the nearest radar image is 200 miles away. Also the hourly and the 10 day rarely if ever jive. 10 day forecast may say %80 chance of storms this afternoon, the hourly will say sunny the whole time with %0 chance of rain and I suppose I could check the radar but oh wait, it doesn‚Äôt work. This app used to be absolutely perfect when I first got it in 2012 but now it‚Äôs just a headache. It‚Äôd be great if you fixed it but it is free so I guess I shouldn‚Äôt complain too much. So a few days later they claimed to have looked into the issue and corrected it. I‚Äôm telling you I wish everyone worked like these guys! It‚Äôs fixed and works flawlessly! The level of support and attention they paid to my measly whining is outstanding. You guys are top notch, thank you. I work outside so having a good weather app is important and you guys are spot on Developer Response , Hi there! Thank you for your feedback. The WeatherBug team has noted all your feedback. We will definitely look into this issue and do our best to keep providing you with accurate weather information. Sorry for the inconvenience. We appreciate your continued support! xlemnrty , 12/03/2018 All weather apps seem to be inaccurate Is it me, or are others experiencing the same issues of inaccurate, not up-to-date weather no matter what app? It seems they all use the same local stations that must be very delayed in their updates to the various apps. Seriously ALWAYS off several degrees, and as for precipitation percentages, they‚Äôre so useless, I have begun to laugh at my own gullibility. A couple of mornings ago was so typical ... I wanted to take a bike ride and began looking at the forecast the prior evening showing ZERO chance of rain the next morning. Re-checked the next morning, and same ZERO % chance so I got dressed for my ride, pumped my tires, raised the garage door, when it began to rain ALL DAY. I re-checked the forecast an hour or so later, and the entire hourly forecast had changed. THE KICKER is that this same app has the audacity to provide a TEN DAY forecast ü§£ü§£ü§£. And almost as bad ... my gullibility to keep checking ü§îü§îü§î. Anyway, I think I‚Äôll go back to the ‚Äústick my head out the door‚Äù method ... it‚Äôs more predictable. I get a bit of a chuckle when folks compare the presentation of info in reviews ... who cares about presentation if the data is unusable. Again ... this doesn‚Äôt seem to be a Weatherbug only issue as I have had the same experience with all four of the apps I‚Äôve tried. It seems that the OLD-fashioned TV weather reports are more accurate the night before than the purported ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù weather apps. Developer Response , Hello, We are sorry to hear about your bad experience. We definitely want to look into this issue and make sure that it is corrected. Please send us an email to iphoneapps@weatherbug.com so that we can fix it for you.We appreciate your support. -WeatherBug Team TexGreenEyes , 06/28/2019 My favorite weather app is screwed up This has been my go-to weather app for years. It gets used multiple times a day, and has never given a hint of trouble. Scratch the glowing praises now because with this last update the app crashes on start-up. I followed the developer‚Äôs advice found in a response to someone else‚Äôs recent complaint and deleted/re-downloaded the app. Bad idea. The app started up once, and then promptly stopped working again, and I lost all my settings for no good reason. Come on, guys. Don‚Äôt let such a good app cause this much frustration. The second star I‚Äôm giving is based on my hope that you‚Äôll get this fixed ASAP. Update: Shortly after I posted my review the app started working as expected. Then this morning, just 3 days later, it‚Äôs back to crashing at startup. I do not want to uninstall/reinstall again, as I did that before you suggested it in response to my original review. It didn‚Äôt work then. I hope this usually excellent app is mended soon. Update #2: It‚Äôs been about a week since my first update, and while the app is working better, it still occasionally crashes at startup. This happens about once every other day. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related, but the problem seems to occur when I first open the app and I‚Äôm not on wifi. Anyway, I‚Äôve updated my stars accordingly. Developer Response , Hi, We are really sorry to hear about your bad experience. We‚Äôd really appreciate it if you can send us an email to iphoneapps@weatherbug.com so we can understand the problem better and try to fix it!
