The recall covers trucks from the 2019 model year, and applies to some 78,264 Rangers globally — specifically, 5,564 are affected in Canada. On those affected trucks, the rear lights may function intermittently or simply not work due to badly installed or misaligned terminals. This means the position lights, brake lights and turn signals may not illuminate fully, reducing the visibility of the truck to other road users. Dealers will repair the issue by adjusting the terminals. This marks the fifth recall for the Ranger this year, its first model year on sale in Canada, which suggests Ford is still working out the bugs on the new model.
