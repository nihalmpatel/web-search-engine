Dark Sky Weather 4+ Jackadam #2 in Weather 4.4, 41.9K Ratings $3.99 Screenshots iPhone iPad Apple Watch Description Dark Sky is the most accurate source of hyperlocal weather information. With down-to-the-minute forecasts, youâ€™ll know exactly when the rain will start or stop, right where youâ€™re standing. (Itâ€™s like magic.) Featured in: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, and more. YOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE Dark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week. BEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS The same technology that powers Dark Skyâ€™s predictions also allows us to make the worldâ€™s first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Skyâ€™s radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where itâ€™s going in the future. PUSH NOTIFICATIONS Dark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc.), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Even if you havenâ€™t opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. TODAY WIDGET The Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance whatâ€™s going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you donâ€™t even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out. TIME MACHINE Explore weather in the past or future. Choose a date and see historical weather data or future predictions based off of seasonal averages. APPLE WATCH Dark Sky looks great on your wrist. Get notifications and check out the weather for the next week with the Dark Sky app built from scratch for Apple Watch.

Ratings and Reviews 4.4 out of 5 41.9K Ratings 41.9K Ratings Editorsâ€™ Choice Being able to track atmospheric pressure to the nearest millibar sounds impressive and all, but sometimes you just want to know if itâ€™s going to rain. Dark Sky tells you exactly how much precipitation to expect and when to expect it, as well as offering cool customizable weather alerts and a mesmerizing time-lapse view of local cloud movements thatâ€™s almost as much fun as splashing in puddles. Bklyn008 , 09/17/2018 Great for weather, awful on the eyes. Iâ€™ve been using Dark Sky for quite a while and have depended on its accuracy and reliability when I want to know what itâ€™s like outside. But with the last big update, I now find that checking the weather with this app is totally unpleasant. The microscopic fonts, weird little balls with tiny numbers in them that I assume are supposed to indicate data by their position on a horizontal line is not not only esthetically displeasing, it takes more time to figure out whatâ€™s going on and what Iâ€™m looking for. I donâ€™t want to spend more than a minute to quickly see what the temperature is and if itâ€™s going to rain or now and when. But the visuals are so cumbersome that I find myself getting annoyed every time I open it. Donâ€™t they have any graphic designers that could help with this? I tried downloading various other weather apps and even used the Apple weather app for a while because itâ€™s easy to read. But I admit I trust Dark Skyâ€™s accuracy more than anyone elseâ€™s. If they could find someone to redesign it, get rid of those silly black bubbles and wasted white space and make it easy on the eyes I would give it five stars for sure. Fingers crossed someone is listening... qazwe32 , 08/19/2019 Hands Down best weather app I donâ€™t write reviews a lot but this one is soo good I had to. Letâ€™s start off by saying it is worth paying 3.99 dollars on this one the first thing that made me get this app is the accuracy itâ€™s 80 to 85 percent accurate Number 2 is the design I like that thereâ€™s a simple but intuitive chart that covers the next 24 hours and I thought it was per 2 hours and going to be a minus but before when I did not have the app yet you made an update where if you press the next 24 hours graph each hour will appear thatâ€™s very cool Number 3 Reason is the the layout I like that itâ€™s not cluttered and very readable Last Reason is there are no adds and protects your privacy which is #1 Reason why I got this app. Thank you ðŸ˜€ and I hope you donâ€™t take off the features while still improving the app. I forgot to mention the maps, notifications, and reporting the weather. The maps are there for you to understand the current weather other maps confuse you all the time. The Notifications are extremely helpful as no weather will catch you off guard I got notified of todayâ€™s forecast as I enabled notifications it said possible drizzle this evening which I like. The Report feature is cool because you make the accurate forecasts even better. Thank you again ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Editorsâ€™ Choice Being able to track atmospheric pressure to the nearest millibar sounds impressive and all, but sometimes you just want to know if itâ€™s going to rain.
