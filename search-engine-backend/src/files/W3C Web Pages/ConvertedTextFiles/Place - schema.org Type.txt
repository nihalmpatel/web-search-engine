Property Expected Type Description Properties from Place additionalProperty PropertyValueÂ  A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism. address PostalAddressÂ  or TextÂ  Physical address of the item. aggregateRating AggregateRatingÂ  The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. amenityFeature LocationFeatureSpecificationÂ  An amenity feature (e.g. a characteristic or service) of the Accommodation.

The code is typically assigned by the parentOrganization and used in structured URLs. For example, in the URL http://www.starbucks.co.uk/store-locator/etc/detail/3047 the code "3047" is a branchCode for a particular branch. containedInPlace PlaceÂ  The basic containment relation between a place and one that contains it.

Properties from Thing additionalType URLÂ  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types.
