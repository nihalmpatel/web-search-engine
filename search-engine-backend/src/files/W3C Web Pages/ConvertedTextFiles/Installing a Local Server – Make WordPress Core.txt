What does AMP stand for? Which local server should I install? This section of the handbook contains tutorials that will walk you through the process of installing one of the four local server programs listed below. Why do I need a local server? #Why do I need a local server? A local server provides the same environment as your web host’s server, allows you to install/run WordPress trunk on your computer, and is an essential tool in contributing to the development of WordPress core. Top ↑ What does AMP stand for? #What does AMP stand for? Some local server programs have AMP in their name, which stands for Apache, MySQL (or MariaDB), and PHP. These are the same programs that are installed on your webhost’s server which allow you to run your WordPress site. Top ↑ Which local server should I install? #Which local server should I install? The four popular local servers are (not in any particular order): MAMP (Mac & Windows) WampServer (Windows) XAMPP (Windows, Mac, Linux) Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV – WordPress specific Vagrant configuration for Windows, Mac, Linux) Your choice of a local server program will primarily depend on which operating system you run on your computer. There are a couple that work on multiple operating systems, and all will give you a solid local development environment.
