Six years later, Antetokounmpo has made a habit of consistently dominating the Knicks, and these days the forward and the rest of the Milwaukee Bucks are running roughshod over the rest of the NBA. Antetokounmpo and the Bucks attempt to run their winning streak to 12 games Monday night when they host the Knicks.   MORE Leaders Points: Giannis Antetokounmpo 30.9 Rebounds: Giannis Antetokounmpo 13.4 Assists: Giannis Antetokounmpo 5.9 FG%: Giannis Antetokounmpo 56.0% Steals: Giannis Antetokounmpo 1.50 Blocks: Brook Lopez 2.42 Defense (Rank) Points: 109.5 (15) Rebounds: 46.7 (25) Assists: 24.4 (17) FG%: 42.1% (2) FT%: 76.3% (15) 3P%: 38.0% (28) Offense (Rank) Points: 120.3 (2) Rebounds: 51.4 (1) Assists: 25.4 (8) FG%: 48.0% (2) FT%: 71.4% (29) 3P%: 34.6% (22) Standings Central Divison   W L Pct GB Milwaukee 17 3 .850 -- Indiana 12 7 .632 4.5 Detroit 7 13 .350 10.0 Chicago 6 14 .300 11.0 Cleveland 5 14 .263 11.5 Full Standings Transactions Date Player Transactions 10/19/2019 Jemerrio Jones Signed as Free Agent 10/19/2019 Rayjon Tucker Waived 10/19/2019 Trevor Lacey Waived 10/19/2019 Jemerrio Jones Waived 10/17/2019 Jaylen Adams Waived Show Transactions Injuries Date Player Status 11/30/2019 Brook Lopez Back soreness Show Injuries © 2019 by STATS.
