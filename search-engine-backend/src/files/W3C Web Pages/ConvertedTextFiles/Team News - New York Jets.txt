Bilal Powell’s 23-yard gain off a screen pass was called back because of an illegal block. Every time the Jets seemed to be getting momentum, a flag flew and they were back to square one. New York’s high-scoring offense repeatedly tripped itself up during a 22-6 loss to the previously winless Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, leaving the Jets with some dubious NFL history. Combined with their loss to the Dolphins, they’re the first team to drop games to a pair of opponents that were 0-7 or worse in one season. “I felt like our defense, this one’s not on them,” coach Adam Gase said. “We did not do enough on offense.”   MORE Jets Headlines Jets’ 3-game win streak ends with self-destruction Dalton returns and leads Bengals to 1st win, 22-6 over Jets Jets’ Bell playing some of ‘best football’ of career Jets’ Maulet has leaped obstacles to become ‘superhero’ Jets’ Darnold sacked criticisms by refusing to be affected Jets try for 4th straight; winless Bengals go back to Dalton Jets sign linebacker Wyatt Ray, grandson of Nat King Cole Playoffs?
