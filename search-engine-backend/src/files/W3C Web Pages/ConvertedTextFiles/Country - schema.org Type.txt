Property Expected Type Description Properties from Place additionalProperty PropertyValueÂ  A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism. address PostalAddressÂ  or TextÂ  Physical address of the item. aggregateRating AggregateRatingÂ  The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. amenityFeature LocationFeatureSpecificationÂ  An amenity feature (e.g. a characteristic or service) of the Accommodation. This generic property does not make a statement about whether the feature is included in an offer for the main accommodation or available at extra costs. branchCode TextÂ  A short textual code (also called "store code") that uniquely identifies a place of business. The code is typically assigned by the parentOrganization and used in structured URLs. For example, in the URL http://www.starbucks.co.uk/store-locator/etc/detail/3047 the code "3047" is a branchCode for a particular branch. containedInPlace PlaceÂ  The basic containment relation between a place and one that contains it. Supersedes containedIn. Inverse property: containsPlace. containsPlace PlaceÂ  The basic containment relation between a place and another that it contains. Inverse property: containedInPlace. event EventÂ  Upcoming or past event associated with this place, organization, or action. Supersedes events. faxNumber TextÂ  The fax number. geo GeoCoordinatesÂ  or GeoShapeÂ  The geo coordinates of the place. geoContains GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a containing geometry to a contained geometry. "a contains b iff no points of b lie in the exterior of a, and at least one point of the interior of b lies in the interior of a". As defined in DE-9IM. geoCoveredBy GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that covers it. As defined in DE-9IM. geoCovers GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a covering geometry to a covered geometry. "Every point of b is a point of (the interior or boundary of) a". As defined in DE-9IM. geoCrosses GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that crosses it: "a crosses b: they have some but not all interior points in common, and the dimension of the intersection is less than that of at least one of them". As defined in DE-9IM. geoDisjoint GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically disjoint: they have no point in common. They form a set of disconnected geometries." (a symmetric relationship, as defined in DE-9IM) geoEquals GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically equal, as defined in DE-9IM. "Two geometries are topologically equal if their interiors intersect and no part of the interior or boundary of one geometry intersects the exterior of the other" (a symmetric relationship) geoIntersects GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) have at least one point in common. As defined in DE-9IM. geoOverlaps GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that geospatially overlaps it, i.e. they have some but not all points in common. As defined in DE-9IM. geoTouches GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) touch: they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points." (a symmetric relationship, as defined in DE-9IM ) geoWithin GeospatialGeometryÂ  or PlaceÂ  Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to one that contains it, i.e. it is inside (i.e. within) its interior. As defined in DE-9IM. globalLocationNumber TextÂ  The Global Location Number (GLN, sometimes also referred to as International Location Number or ILN) of the respective organization, person, or place. The GLN is a 13-digit number used to identify parties and physical locations. hasMap MapÂ  or URLÂ  A URL to a map of the place. Supersedes map, maps. isAccessibleForFree BooleanÂ  A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Supersedes free. isicV4 TextÂ  The International Standard of Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revision 4 code for a particular organization, business person, or place. latitude NumberÂ  or TextÂ  The latitude of a location. For example 37.42242 (WGS 84). logo ImageObjectÂ  or URLÂ  An associated logo. longitude NumberÂ  or TextÂ  The longitude of a location. For example -122.08585 (WGS 84). maximumAttendeeCapacity IntegerÂ  The total number of individuals that may attend an event or venue. openingHoursSpecification OpeningHoursSpecificationÂ  The opening hours of a certain place. photo ImageObjectÂ  or PhotographÂ  A photograph of this place. Supersedes photos. publicAccess BooleanÂ  A flag to signal that the Place is open to public visitors. If this property is omitted there is no assumed default boolean value review ReviewÂ  A review of the item. Supersedes reviews. slogan TextÂ  A slogan or motto associated with the item. smokingAllowed BooleanÂ  Indicates whether it is allowed to smoke in the place, e.g. in the restaurant, hotel or hotel room. specialOpeningHoursSpecification OpeningHoursSpecificationÂ  The special opening hours of a certain place. Use this to explicitly override general opening hours brought in scope by openingHoursSpecification or openingHours. telephone TextÂ  The telephone number. Properties from Thing additionalType URLÂ  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName TextÂ  An alias for the item. description TextÂ  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription TextÂ  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValueÂ  or TextÂ  or URLÂ  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObjectÂ  or URLÂ  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWorkÂ  or URLÂ  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name TextÂ  The name of the item. potentialAction ActionÂ  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URLÂ  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWorkÂ  or EventÂ  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URLÂ  URL of the item. Instances of Country may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description addressCountry GeoCoordinatesÂ  or GeoShapeÂ  or PostalAddressÂ  The country. For example, USA. You can also provide the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. countryOfOrigin MovieÂ  or TVEpisodeÂ  or TVSeasonÂ  or TVSeriesÂ  The country of the principal offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie or program. nationality PersonÂ  Nationality of the person.
