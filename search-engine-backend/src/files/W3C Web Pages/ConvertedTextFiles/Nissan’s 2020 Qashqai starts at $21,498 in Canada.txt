HOME / Nissan / Qashqai / Auto News / News / Nissan's 2020 Qashqai starts at $21,498 in Canada The popular crossover will get new standard safety tech and a fresh look for the coming model year by Coleman Molnar   | November 28, 2019 SHARE STORY The newest version of Nissan Canada’s second-best selling model, the Qashqai, has been given a price tag for 2020.  With a fresh exterior design and a host of new and upgraded safety features coming standard, the popular crossover, which lives between the Kicks and Rogue in the brand’s lineup, will start at $21,498 for the base S MT front-wheel-drive model.  Front-wheel-drive comes standard on the S and SV trims, while intelligent all-wheel-drive is offered on the S, SV and SL trims. For that base offering, the 2020 version rings in at a minimum of $1,300 more than the previous model-year Qashqai. But that additional stack of cash does earn a fair bit of extra safety and comfort tech, including a six-way manual adjustable driver’s seat, rear-seat heating and cooling, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, intelligent auto headlights, traffic sign recognition, driver attention assist, rear sonar, rear intelligent emergency braking, high-beam assist, lane-departure warning and intelligent emergency braking with pedestrian detection, all of which comes standard.  RELATED SUV Review: 2019 Nissan Qashqai SUV Review: 2019 Honda HR-V Touring As options, Nissan will also throw in perks like ProPILOT Assist, door-to-door nav and NissanConnect powered by SiriusXM.  The new Qashqai received a visual refresh, too, creating an all-around sportier feel. A reconfigured front end with updated LED headlights, a V-motion grille and an aggressive hood provide a more angular first impression, which is backed up by new 19-inch alloy wheels and visually adjusted taillights. Power, meanwhile, comes from a 141-horsepower 2.0-litre four-cylinder mated to either an Xtronic transmission with eco mode; or a six-speed manual in the S FWD model.
