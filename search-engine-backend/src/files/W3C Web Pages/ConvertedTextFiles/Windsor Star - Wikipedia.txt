F. Herman. The Border Cities Star was a daily newspaper published from September 3rd, 1918 until June 28th, 1935. The founders W. F. Herman and Hugh Graybiel purchased the existing daily newspaper, the Windsor Record (known as the Evening Record from 1890 until November 1917), from Mr. John A. McKay on August 6th, 1918.[2] There was some conflict before the men purchased the newspaper. The Windsor Record only had partial wire service, and some felt that the national and international news was not sufficiently covered. Originally, the Border Cities Star was intended to be a rival daily newspaper to the Windsor Record. However, Mr. Herman’s application to Canadian Press Limited for full wire service was denied because of opposition by Mr. McKay.[citation needed]. Mr. McKay had held a variety of committee executive positions at the organization over the years. Mr. McKay eventually agreed to subscribe to the full wire service and sold the Windsor Record to W.F. Herman for an inflated price. Many viewed this as a flaw of the Canadian Press Limited. The wire service, which was subsidized by government funds, was run mainly by a group of publishers who could use it as a way of limiting competition and increasing the value of their own newspapers (Border Cities Era: October 18th, 1918, page 7)[3] Herman had previous experience in the newspaper industry, having previously owned the Prince Albert Daily Herald, the Saskatoon Capital and the Regina Leader-Post. Herman became President and Graybiel assumed the role of Business Manager.[citation needed]They changed the name of the 'Windsor Record' to the 'Border Cities Star' to reflect not only Windsor, but all the surrounding communities.[citation needed] On page 4 of its inaugural issue, the new owners state that in their "Aims and Endeavors" that they intend to make this "a worth-while newspaper for worth-while people".[4] They proposed two main goals: the first was to work with and build up local institutions and organizations. The newspaper "must endeavor to become one with its community, to enter closely into its daily life and being, and to voice for the community the otherwise largely inarticulate striving for the attainment of the largest self-development".[citation needed]The second goal was "to be worthy of Canada". They appealed to Canadian pride and nationalism, in particular with regards to Canadians' contributions to the ongoing war, and stated their intention "to be broad, to be faithful, to be progressive and forward-looking, to be free and independent and unprejudiced.[citation needed] The Canadian who is not proud of our mighty country has no right or title to its citizenship." They identified a couple other goals; one was the revision of tariffs, and the second was to "uphold the English language as the only proper language and method of instruction in the primary grades of the public schools".[citation needed] This was a somewhat controversial stand, given the ongoing conflict between Anglophones and Francophones over educational rights in Ontario.[5] Initially, the Border Cities Star was published from the Record Printing Company offices at 36 Sandwich Street West, on the north side of Sandwich Street, just west of Ferry Street. In 1923, it moved to a building on Ferry Street, and in 1927, it expanded into adjacent, new, larger premises at the corner of Ferry Street and Pitt Street.[citation needed] When the city of Windsor annexed Walkerville, East Windsor (Ford City), Sandwich, and Ojibway in 1935, the Border Cities Star changed its name to the Windsor Daily Star. Although Herman died in 1938, the paper continued under the direction of his wife, Adie Knox Herman, along with Hugh Graybiel and W. L. (Lum) Clark.[6]. In 1959, it became simply, the Windsor Star. The paper was sold to Southam Press in 1971, and then to Canwest (who bought Southam Press) in 2000.[7] In November 1996, the paper opened a printing facility in south-central Windsor.[6] In 2013, the Windsor Star moved to a new facility at 300 Ouellette Avenue, formerly occupied by television station CHWI.[8][9] The former 167 Ferry Street building was sold to the University of Windsor, who opened a new downdown campus at the facility in 2015.[10] In February 2019, the paper announced that it will no longer publish a Monday edition effective March 4, 2019.[11] Circulation[edit] The Windsor Star has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by 22 percent to 49,613 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.[12] Daily average [13] 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 See also[edit] List of newspapers in Canada References[edit] ^ "2015 Daily Newspaper Circulation Spreadsheet (Excel)".
