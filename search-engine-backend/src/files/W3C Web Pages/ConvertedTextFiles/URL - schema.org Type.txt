For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".

Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards. publishingPrinciples CreativeWork  or Organization  or Person  The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. relatedLink WebPage  A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. releaseNotes SoftwareApplication  Description of what changed in this version. replyToUrl UserComments  The URL at which a reply may be posted to the specified UserComment. roleName Role  A role played, performed or filled by a person or organization.

This includes runtime environments and shared libraries that are not included in the application distribution package, but required to run the application (Examples: DirectX, Java or .NET runtime). Supersedes, requirements. speakable Article  or WebPage  Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. sport SportsOrganization  A type of sport (e.g. Baseball). storageRequirements SoftwareApplication  Storage requirements (free space required). targetUrl AlignmentObject  The URL of a node in an established educational framework. temporalCoverage CreativeWork  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945". Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.
