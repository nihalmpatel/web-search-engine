Property Expected Type Description Properties from WebPage breadcrumb BreadcrumbList  or Text  A set of links that can help a user understand and navigate a website hierarchy. lastReviewed Date  Date on which the content on this web page was last reviewed for accuracy and/or completeness. mainContentOfPage WebPageElement  Indicates if this web page element is the main subject of the page. Supersedes aspect. primaryImageOfPage ImageObject  Indicates the main image on the page. relatedLink URL  A link related to this web page, for example to other related web pages. reviewedBy Organization  or Person  People or organizations that have reviewed the content on this web page for accuracy and/or completeness. significantLink URL  One of the more significant URLs on the page. Typically, these are the non-navigation links that are clicked on the most. Supersedes significantLinks. speakable SpeakableSpecification  or URL  Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech. The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned. 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property. For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property. specialty Specialty  One of the domain specialities to which this web page's content applies.

When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.

The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit. sourceOrganization Organization  The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. spatial Place  The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate. spatialCoverage Place  The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. sponsor Organization  or Person  A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. e.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. temporal DateTime  or Text  The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate. temporalCoverage DateTime  or Text  or URL  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945". Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval. text Text  The textual content of this CreativeWork. thumbnailUrl URL  A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing. timeRequired Duration  Approximate or typical time it takes to work with or through this learning resource for the typical intended target audience, e.g. 'PT30M', 'PT1H25M'. translationOfWork CreativeWork  The work that this work has been translated from. e.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species” Inverse property: workTranslation. translator Organization  or Person  Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. typicalAgeRange Text  The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. version Number  or Text  The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. video Clip  or VideoObject  An embedded video object. workExample CreativeWork  Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. eg.

Inverse property: translationOfWork. Properties from Thing additionalType URL  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text  An alias for the item. description Text  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription Text  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValue  or Text  or URL  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.

Instances of AboutPage may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description ownershipFundingInfo NewsMediaOrganization  or Organization  For an Organization (often but not necessarily a NewsMediaOrganization), a description of organizational ownership structure; funding and grants. In a news/media setting, this is with particular reference to editorial independence. Note that the funder is also available and can be used to make basic funder information machine-readable.
