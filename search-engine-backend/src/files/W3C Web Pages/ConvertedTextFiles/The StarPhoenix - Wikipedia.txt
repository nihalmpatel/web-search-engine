In 1909, it became a daily paper and, in 1910, was renamed the Saskatoon Capital. The paper was sold and bought several times between its inception and the 1920s, at one point being owned by W. F. Herman, the future owner and publisher of the Windsor Star.[2] By 1927, there were two daily papers in Saskatoon: the Saskatoon Daily Star and the Daily Phoenix. In January 1928, both papers were bought by the Sifton family of Winnipeg and amalgamated into the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix. In the early 1980s the spelling of the newspaper name was modified to StarPhoenix. Between the 1928 amalgamation and the launch of the Saskatoon edition of Metro in April 2012, the StarPhoenix was the city's only daily newspaper. In 1996, the StarPhoenix was bought by the Hollinger newspaper chain. It was subsequently sold to CanWest Global Communications in 2000 and became part of the Southam Newspapers division now called CanWest News Service. CanWest was acquired by Postmedia News, Inc. and is the current owner of The StarPhoenix. In 2015, the StarPhoenix press began printing the Regina Leader-Post in addition to its own print edition, after the Regina press was shut down.[3] Circulation[edit] The StarPhoenix has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by 28 percent to 39,008 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.[4] Daily average [5] 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 See also[edit] List of newspapers in Canada References[edit] ^ "2015 Daily Newspaper Circulation Spreadsheet (Excel)".
