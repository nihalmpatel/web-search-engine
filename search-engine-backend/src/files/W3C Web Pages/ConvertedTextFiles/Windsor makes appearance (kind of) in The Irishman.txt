Dalson Chen, Windsor Star Updated: November 29, 2019 Robert De Niro in a scene from Martin Scorsese's The Irishman. Netflix Share Adjust Comment Print There’s been a lot of talk about Martin Scorsese’s latest crime epic The Irishman — but has anyone mentioned Windsor’s cameo in the movie? All right, it’s a bit of a stretch to say our community actually appears on the screen. But in the film’s opening minutes, the hitman Frank Sheeran — portrayed by Robert De Niro — can be seen consulting a map for a road trip. In red marker, he circles his destination: Detroit. Residents of Windsor-Essex won’t fail to notice Sheeran’s map is detailed enough to name their city and region. It even has Amherstburg, Kingsville, Tilbury and Leamington. Sure, it’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, with zero bearing on the story. But at least we can say Windsor made it into a Scorsese movie.
