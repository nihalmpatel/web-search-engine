WENN - World Entertainment News Network Updated: December 1, 2019 Share Adjust Comment Print Producers behind America’s Got Talent are “working with” Gabrielle Union to remedy concerns the actress raised about the show before she was fired from its judging panel. The Bring It On beauty was recently dropped from the line up of Simon Cowell’s talent series after one season, amid reports suggesting she was axed for making multiple complaints to TV bosses about the workplace culture. Her husband, retired basketball ace Dwyane Wade, took to Twitter on Wednesday and appeared to confirm the claims, indicating she had taken a stand against the alleged criticism of her physical appearance and racist jokes, and the news prompted stars like Grey’s Anatomy actress Ellen Pompeo and Will & Grace’s Debra Messing to condemn network officials at NBC and voice their support for Union. So when i got the news that my wife was being fired—my first question was obviously why!? Iam still waiting on a good answer to that question. But if anyone knows @itsgabrielleu or have heard of her you know she’s an advocate for our community and culture.— DWade (@DwyaneWade) November 27, 2019 Now America’s Got Talent producers at Cowell’s Syco Entertainment company, production firm Fremantle, and bosses at NBC have addressed the controversy in a joint statement, vowing to listen to Union’s grievances and take action where necessary. “We remain committed to ensuring a respectful workplace for all employees and take very seriously any questions about workplace culture,” they told People.com. “We are working with Ms. Union through her representatives to hear more about her concerns, following which we will take whatever next steps may be appropriate.” However, it appears Union is not impressed with the statement after reposting a note about what a “solid apology” should include by writer Joelle Monique.

Sincerely admit wrong doing directly to the offended party. 2. Be twice as loud correcting your mistake as you were making the mistake. 3. Lay out steps to correct your behavior in the future.” “Anything less is covering your own a**,” concluded the message, which featured a meme of Oprah Winfrey with the words, “I will not accept that”. Suggesting she sides with Monique’s assessment of the America’s Got Talent producers’ press release, Union wrote, “This! This! AND THIIISSSSSSS (sic)!!!!!!” This! This!
