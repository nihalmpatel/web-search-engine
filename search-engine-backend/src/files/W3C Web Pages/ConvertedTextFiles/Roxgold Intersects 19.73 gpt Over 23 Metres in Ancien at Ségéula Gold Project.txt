Ancien Longsection Business Wire Share Adjust Comment Print TORONTO — Roxgold Inc. (“Roxgold” or the “Company”) (TSX: ROXG) (OTCQX: ROGFF) is pleased to announce drilling results from the Company’s Séguéla gold project (“Séguéla”) located in Côte d’Ivoire. Highlights: Reverse Circulation (“RC”) drilling at Ancien: 23 metres (“m”) at 19.73 grams per tonne gold (“g/t Au”) in drill hole SGRC329 from 1m 8m at 11.82g/t Au in drill hole SGRC322 from 82m 8m at 8.77g/t Au in drill hole SGRC324 from 37m 7m at 8.34g/t Au in drill hole SGRC325 from 24m 14m at 5.09g/t Au in drill hole SGRC330 from 14m “The exploration success at the Séguéla Project continues to build confidence in the growth potential at our newest development project,” stated John Dorward, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With eight of the first ten holes hitting significant mineralization, these drill results demonstrate how Ancien is quickly becoming a high value target – underscoring our vision of Séguéla as a project where the Antenna deposit is supported by a portfolio of high-quality satellite pits along the main structures of the Boulder-Agouti trend. Our Séguéla exploration program continues with two drills turning, increasing to four by early December, in support of releasing a PEA early next year.” “These excellent results highlight the potential for further growth in our mineral resource inventory” commented Paul Weedon, Vice President, Exploration. “The reconnaissance 10-hole program at Ancien was very successful in delineating a clear high grade core which is open at depth, while the strike extensions remain to be fully tested along this prospective trend. Previous broad spaced geochemistry correlates well with a regional structure that hosts Ancien, and presents excellent potential for additional high grade prospects. We are looking forward to having drilling resume at Ancien in December.” Séguéla Project – Ancien Exploration activities at Séguéla have continued to progress with the objective of delineating additional mineral resources within close proximity to Antenna. The current targets, including Agouti, Boulder and Ancien, are within 10 kilometres of the Antenna deposit. At Ancien, approximately 7 kilometres south-east of Antenna, 10 RC/DD drill holes were completed during the quarter, following up 2 previous reconnaissance RC drill holes, one of which returned a broad zone of high grade (16m at 9.3 g/t Au from 39m: SGRC172). All results have now been received and highlight a very well-defined high grade zone. Drill highlights include: 23m at 19.73g/t Au in drill hole SGRC329 from 1m 8m at 11.82g/t Au in drill hole SGRC322 from 82m 8m at 8.77g/t Au in drill hole SGRC324 from 37m 7m at 8.34g/t Au in drill hole SGRC325 from 24m 14m at 5.09g/t Au in drill hole SGRC330 from 14m 4m at 2.92g/t Au in drill hole SGRC323 from 39m 7m at 2.39g/t Au in drill hole SGRC326 from 67m Previously released (refer November 11 Press release) 18m at 5.8 g/t Au from 61m in SGRD244, including 2m at 12.9 g/t from 65m; and 3m at 17.7 g/t Au from 75m. High grade gold is associated with zones of intense quartz veining and minor sulphides (pyrite-pyrrhotite) within a 30-50m wide envelope of strongly sheared basalt. High grade gold mineralisation remains open down plunge. Additionally, the Ancien host structure can be traced in regional aeromagnetics for several kilometres to the north and south of Ancien where, despite encouraging historic regional soil geochemistry, very limited drilling was carried out and presents a compelling target with excellent potential for further high-grade gold discoveries. An RC drill program is scheduled for December 2019 to target strike and depth extensions, ahead of a maiden Inferred resource estimate in early 2020. Figure 1. Ancien Longsection Figure 2. Séguéla Satellite Prospects The Séguéla Gold Project is located approximately 240 kilometres north-west of Yamoussoukro, the political capital of Côte d’Ivoire, and approximately 480 kilometres north-west of Abidjan, the commercial capital of the country. The Antenna gold deposit consists of near-surface, potentially open pittable mineralization and is ideally located near existing infrastructure including grid power, transport and water resources.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control Séguéla All drilling data completed by Roxgold utilized the following procedures and methodologies. All drilling was carried out under the supervision of Roxgold personnel. RC drilling used a 5.25 inch face sampling pneumatic hammer with samples collected into 60 litre plastic bags. Samples were kept dry by maintaining enough air pressure to exclude groundwater inflow. If water ingress exceeded the air pressure, RC drilling was stopped, and drilling converted to diamond core tails. Aircore (“AC”) drilling was collected in one metre intervals and sampled in a similar fashion to RC methods. Once collected, RC and AC samples were riffle split through a three-tier splitter to yield a 12.5% representative sample for submission to the analytical laboratory. The residual 87.5% sample were stored at the drill site until assay results were received and validated. Coarse reject samples for all mineralized samples corresponding to significant intervals are retained and stored on-site at the Company controlled core yard. DD drill holes were drilled with HQ sized diamond drill bits. The core was logged, marked up for sampling using standard lengths of one metre. Samples were then cut into equal halves using a diamond saw. One half of the core was left in the original core box and stored in a secure location at the Company core yard at Séguéla. The other half was sampled, catalogued and placed into sealed bags and securely stored at the site until shipment. All RC, AC and DD core samples were shipped to ALS Laboratories preparation laboratory in Yamassoukro for preparation. Samples were dried and crushed by the Lab and a 250-gram split prepared from the coarse crushed material, prior to pulverization and preparation of a 200g sample. Samples are then shipped via commercial courier to ALS’s analytical facility in Kumasi, Ghana where routine gold analysis using a 50-gram charge and fire assay with an atomic absorption finish was completed. Quality control procedures included the systematic insertion of blanks, duplicates and sample standards into the sample stream. In addition, the Lab inserted its own quality control samples.
