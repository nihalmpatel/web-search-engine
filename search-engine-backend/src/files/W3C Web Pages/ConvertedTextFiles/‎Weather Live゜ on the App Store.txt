Ratings and Reviews 4.6 out of 5 180.2K Ratings 180.2K Ratings LadyFiana , 01/15/2019 Weather: It‚Äôs very important and informative!! Everyone should be interested in the weather they are going to be out in, breathing the kind of air we have to now. This app is especially informative and pretty to look at, all at the same time! Our weather is one of the foremost topics in the news, our children‚Äôs children‚Äôs futures, and what is happening all around the world every second of every day. A look into a tiny piece of what‚Äôs ahead of us, It‚Äôs important to us all. You wouldn‚Äôt take a short trip into a forecasted storm, hurricane or blizzard would you, not if you could avoid having a bad experience. Sure you can call at the destinations end, but what about the middle part of your trip/week? Weather is nature, and we all know how unpredictable nature can be. Not all things on your computers, iPads or iPhones are really important to guide you through your week. It‚Äôs nice to know you have immediate options to plan your trip/week with a simple push of a button, isn‚Äôt it? I like knowing and seeing a little ahead, we have way to much stress in our lives, this app is a plus! Don‚Äôt forget, the atmosphere everywhere HAS & will now forever KEEP changing! I live on the west coast, and it‚Äôs disappearing. Soon it will be gone. Malibu & Hwy.#1 (the coast Hwy.) will be a place in history. I‚Äôve been watching it everyday for many years!! That‚Äôs weather changes my friends! Have great days ahead, West Coast Diana Developer Response , Thank you for your kind words!

Divine beginnings , 04/02/2019 Great App I love this app it‚Äôs how I get my grandson ready for school I check the weather in 2 cities the one we live in and the one he goes to school in to properly get him ready and it‚Äôs never far off. I have relied on it for our first two years of school and I will use it to travel w/ family to various locations....I love it and it‚Äôs great and very helpful to me when I‚Äôm in school as I went back to get my degree in psychology and I was required to take a astronomy class and it helped me remember the phases of the moon each day it told me the times the sun would rise & set as well as those times for the moon it gives the moons general location if u upgrade and tap on that part of the app/tab... I‚Äôm not sure how it could be made better or if it can be made better but up til this point it has served me well and I just love it...ü•∞üòçüòò Mstabatha57 Developer Response , Thank you for your kind words!

Reyerdaisy , 07/03/2018 Informative and easy to understand While this app is informative and easy to comprehend, it would be helpful to have an EASY way to clear the notification to get the abnormally large number in red on the corner of the app-so far I have had no luck in discovering how to clear the numbers of the app icon. I love the information you provide, and the only other thing I could suggest was an explanation of what certain things mean. For example, there is a UV scale and there is no gram of reference for an explanation of the scale-it‚Äôs basically a number 1-12 and says 11 is high up rays and to take care when exposed but in all honesty it is just a number to me, simply because I don‚Äôt understand the scale. It would be helpful to have a bit of educational material to explain what different things mean and how they actually affect your environment. Thanks for all the work you have done on this app! I really enjoy it, I am just that big a nerd to want to actually understand all the info you provide! üòÅ Developer Response , Thank you for the review. The large number in the red circle display current temperature for the first notification in your list. If you feel it's bothering you please go to the app's settings - Display tab - disable Shown temperature on badge. We will also consider your suggestion about the UV scale comments in our future updates. Thank you for using our app! Information Seller IAC Search & Media Europe Ltd.
