Nick Brancaccio / Windsor Star Share Adjust Comment Print Santa was busy in Windsor-Essex Saturday night. He was the main attraction in the downtown Windsor Santa Claus parade Saturday night which had a delayed start because Santa and the CP Holiday Train made a stop in Windsor prior to the parade. Santa was also expected to be in the Leamington Winter Nights Christmas Lights Parade Saturday night. Windsor’s parade route and time was changed this year to go along Riverside Drive West and turning south along Ouellette Avenue. There were marching bands, floats with lots of lights, sled dogs, old-fashioned carolling, and of course Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Ethan Wilson, front centre, and Chatham’s Royal Canadian Legion Branch 642 Pipes and Drums were the first band playing and marching in Windsor’s Santa Parade Saturday.
