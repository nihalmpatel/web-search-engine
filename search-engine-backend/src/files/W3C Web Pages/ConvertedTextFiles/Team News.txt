(AP) Vic Fangio won't play any of those self-described silly games this week; he's already announced Drew Lock as his starting quarterback for the Broncos' game at Houston on Sunday. Lock became the Broncos' first QB to win his first start in his rookie season since John Elway and Gary Kubiak did so in 1983 when he capitalized on short fields and a big target in Courtland Sutton for a 23-20 win over the Chargers. Fangio acknowledged afterward that he was fibbing Friday when he said he needed to review the film to make a decision between Lock and Brandon Allen; he knew Thursday after Lock's second solid practice that he'd get the nod.   MORE Broncos Headlines Broncos QB shuffle a tired tune in Denver McManus’ 53-yard field goal lifts Denver past Chargers 23-20 Rookie QB Drew Lock starting for Broncos vs. Chargers Broncos activate Lock off IR, don’t name him starter Broncos coach still not saying who will start at QB Lock used time on IR to slow his mind, speed his growth WR Keenan Allen, CB Chris Harris Jr. resume rivalry Broncos increase QB Drew Lock’s workload, no decision yet Drew Lock’s status remains prime topic with Broncos QB conundrum confronts Broncos coach Vic Fangio AFC West Division Team W L T Pct Kansas City 8 4 0 .667 Oakland 6 6 0 .500 Denver 4 8 0 .333 Los Angeles 4 8 0 .333 Full Standings Leaders Pass Yds: J.
