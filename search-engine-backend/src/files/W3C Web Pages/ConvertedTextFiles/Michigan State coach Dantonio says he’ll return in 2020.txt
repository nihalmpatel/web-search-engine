Leon Halip / Getty Images Share Adjust Comment Print Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio says he intends to return for his 14th season with the Spartans in 2020. “My intentions are there,” he told reporters Tuesday. “Absolutely. My father always taught me to complete circles, and that’s what I’m trying to do.” Michigan State (4-6, 2-5 Big Ten) has lost five straight and is in danger of posting its second losing season in four years. They are coming off a 44-14 defeat to rival Michigan in Ann Arbor on Saturday. They will need to sweep their remaining games at Rutgers on Saturday and at home on Nov. 30 against Maryland to become bowl eligible. Since taking over in 2007, Dantonio has guided Michigan State to a 111-57 record and 10 bowl games. After posting at least 11 wins in five out of six seasons between 2010 and 2015, the Spartans have only reached double-digit wins once (10 in 2017). They haven’t been to the Rose Bowl since beating Stanford 24-20 on Jan. 1, 2014. Dantonio, 63, surpassed Duffy Daugherty (109 wins from 1954-72) as the winningest coach in program history earlier this year. –Field Level Media No. 2 Michigan State beats Wisconsin, wraps up Big Ten title This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
