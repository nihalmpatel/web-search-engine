That's the good news. The bad news is Vegas, which has won two straight four different times during an up-and-down start to the season, has yet to put together a three-game winning streak. And if the playoffs were to begin on Sunday, the Golden Knights, in a three-way tie for fourth place in the Pacific Division with Vancouver and Calgary, would be on the outside looking in. However, December has been a good month for Vegas during its short history.   MORE Golden Knights Headlines Knights aim to extend win streak on road vs. Rangers Alex Tuch lifts Golden Knights past Coyotes in shootout Stastny's OT goal caps comeback, Vegas beats Predators 4-3 Stars tie record with 7th straight win, 4-2 over Vegas McDavid scores 2 to lead Oilers past Vegas, 4-2 Sharks topple Golden Knights 2-1 in overtime Fleury makes amazing save to hold off Leafs for 450th win Karlsson scores 2, Fleury and Vegas blanks Calgary, 6-0 Carter gets winner in 1,000th game, Kings top Golden Knights Crawford, Blackhawks win 5-3 for 1st victory over Vegas Leaders Points: M.
