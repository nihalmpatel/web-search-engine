The disgraced actor, who is serving time for the sexual assault of Andrea Constand in 2004, spent America’s Thanksgiving holiday locked up, but that didn’t stop him from having a series of messages sent out via social media early on Friday. After wishing followers a “Happy thanksgiving” from “The Educator and Political Prisoner”, he began to rail against the press, writing, “It’s #BlackFriday, so let’s spend our dollars with #BlackPressUSA & all Black media outlets that propel the truth and the facts, not Fake News. The truth is in the pudding, this week Black Press USA proved its power and relevance to the world.” He then shared a link to a Black Press USA article, titled, “Bill Cosby Spoke From the Prison and the Whole World Listened”, detailing his recent chat with the website — his first interview from behind bars, in which he insisted he will never show remorse for his crimes because he’s convinced he was “set up”. It’s #BlackFriday, so lets spend our dollars with #BlackPressUSA & all Black media outlets that propel the truth and the facts, not Fake News. The truth is in the pudding, this week Black Press USA proved its power and relevance to the world. https://t.co/JPudwjr9Ka— Bill Cosby (@BillCosby) November 29, 2019 Cosby went on to condemn a number of major publications and websites. “No longer should we succumb to the fear of many mainstream media outlets like Associated Press, CNN, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post & Radar Online to name a few,” he posted. “Black Friday + Black People = BlackPressUSA.” Related Bill Cosby hit with $2.75 million legal bill Bill Cosby appeals 2018 conviction for Pennsylvania sex attack Bill Cosby deprived of fair trial, his lawyers argue The 82-year-old was sentenced to serve three to 10 years behind bars after a jury found him guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Constand last year.
