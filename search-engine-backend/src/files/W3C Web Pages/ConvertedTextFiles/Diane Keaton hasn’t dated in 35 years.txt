The Annie Hall star famously dated several leading men throughout her early career, including Al Pacino and Warren Beatty. But speaking to the August issue of InStyle magazine, the actress confessed she’s been out of the dating game for some time. “I haven’t been on a date in, I would say, 35 years,” the 73-year-old shared, adding “No dates.” While The Godfather star insisted she has a lot of male friends, she shared there’s been no “mwah-mwah”, and suggested she never gets asked out because she’s too busy with work. “Never, all right!” she laughed. Speaking to People magazine earlier this year, Diane also opened up about her relationship status, and confessed she’s “not sad” that she never wed. “I don’t think it would have been a good idea for me to have married,” she reflected. “I’m sure they’re happy about it, too.” Dakota Johnson better be careful: Diane Keaton gushes over ‘gorgeous’ Chris Martin on ‘Ellen’ Diane Keaton supports Woody Allen amid allegations of sexual abuse ’Poms’ review: Diane Keaton comedy is too embarrassed of itself to be empowering Hiatus House celebrates 40 years, recalls celebrity breakup and Windsor's generosity...
