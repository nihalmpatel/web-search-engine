We also sincerely apologise for causing trouble.” Watanabe Entertainment, also without naming Osaka, added their own apology for “remarks inconsiderate of diversity in an era where diversity is respected,” saying the duo had been severely warned and steps taken to raise their awareness of the issue. Neither Watanabe Entertainment nor Naomi Osaka’s management office in Japan was immediately available to comment. Osaka, who will turn 22 next month, was born in Japan to a Haitian father and Japanese mother but moved to the United States when she was young. She has been widely hailed in Japan, which has traditionally seen itself as a racially homogeneous country, although successful mixed-race athletes such as Osaka herself, sprinter Asuka Cambridge and baseball pitcher Yu Darvish are challenging that image. In January, Japanese noodle company Nissin had to remove a controversial commercial in which a cartoon character depicting Osaka was shown with pale skin and light brown hair after it prompted an outcry. Nissin said it had not intended to “whitewash” Osaka and promised to pay more attention to diversity issues.
