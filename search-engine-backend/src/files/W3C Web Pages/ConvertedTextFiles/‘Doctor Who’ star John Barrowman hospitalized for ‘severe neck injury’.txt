An MRI revealed that Barrowman had a facet joint injury in his C5/6 discs in his spine. View this post on Instagram Procedure done. It was a bit uncomfortable.

According to the Mayfield Clinic, pain in nerve endings can occur if the cartilage inside the facet joint of the spine breaks down and becomes inflamed. View this post on Instagram #fanfamily I had an MRI and they’ve found the root of the problem which is a C5/6 facet joint injury. Hopefully a series of intraspinal injections will reduce inflammation and get me back up & running again in time for Monday’s show in Manchester. Fortunately Glasgow was able to reschedule us to Tuesday night so I’m looking forward to that too! @scottmale #stevengill (my brother-in-law the #neuro surgeon) #NotFeelingSoFabulous but a massive blessing to have you all out there sending your positive thoughts and messages. Thank you.

The British-American actor is well-known for portraying Captain Jack Harkness in Doctor Who and Torchwood, and as Malcolm Merlyn in the CW series Arrow.    Saskatoon police lip sync video finishes 3rd in U.S. competition This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
