Actually, it was a miracle that no one froze. Game time temperature at BMO Field was minus 9C for the start of the second match of the CONCACAF Champions League series between Toronto FC and Independiente de Chorrera (CAI), though the wind chill made it seem like minus 16C. And it only got colder. And while TFC, facing a monumental 4-0 deficit heading in to the match, brought all the attacking heat it could muster against its Panamanian opponents, it wasn’t enough. The game ended 1-1 and CAI won the series 5-1 on aggregate to move on to the Champions League quarterfinals — a considerable disappointment for TFC, who made it all the way to the Champions League final last year. Still, the Reds deserved points for effort. Toronto completely dominated possession (75%-25%) and out-shot CAI 28-6, including 10-3 on target. Scarborough’s Jordan Hamilton put the Reds ahead 1-0 in the 19th minute with a beautiful header off a nice feed by Justin Morrow. Five minutes after that, Morrow broke in but couldn’t get the shot past CAI goalkeeper Jose Guerra, who was outstanding all evening. Hamilton just missed with a second header in the 32nd minute with Guerra made a diving stop. Even though Toronto dominated in the second half, CAI scored to tie it in the 67th minute when Omar Browne scored on a breakaway. Moments before the play evolved, Hamilton appeared to be fouled but there was no call. Michael Bradley was given a yellow card for arguing the non-call. Toronto kept pouring it on after that, but couldn’t beat Guerra. The Reds open the MLS schedule on Saturday in Philadelphia.
