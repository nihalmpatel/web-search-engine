StatisticalPopulation - schema.org Type schema.org Documentation Schemas Home StatisticalPopulation This term is proposed for full integration into Schema.org, pending implementation feedback and adoption from applications and websites. Thing > Intangible > StatisticalPopulation A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property populationType is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a StatisticalPopulation representing all Persons with a homeLocation of East Podunk California, would be described by applying the appropriate homeLocation and populationType properties to a StatisticalPopulation item that stands for that set of people. The properties numConstraints and constrainingProperties are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a populationType of Event or NewsArticle could be used. See also Observation, and the data and datasets overview for more details.

Property Expected Type Description Properties from StatisticalPopulation constrainingProperty IntegerÂ  Indicates a property used as a constraint to define a StatisticalPopulation with respect to the set of entities corresponding to an indicated type (via populationType). numConstraints IntegerÂ  Indicates the number of constraints (not counting populationType) defined for a particular StatisticalPopulation. This helps applications understand if they have access to a sufficiently complete description of a StatisticalPopulation. populationType ClassÂ  Indicates the populationType common to all members of a StatisticalPopulation. Properties from Thing additionalType URLÂ  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName TextÂ  An alias for the item. description TextÂ  A description of the item. disambiguatingDescription TextÂ  A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. identifier PropertyValueÂ  or TextÂ  or URLÂ  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. image ImageObjectÂ  or URLÂ  An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject. mainEntityOfPage CreativeWorkÂ  or URLÂ  Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. Inverse property: mainEntity. name TextÂ  The name of the item. potentialAction ActionÂ  Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URLÂ  URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. subjectOf CreativeWorkÂ  or EventÂ  A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Inverse property: about. url URLÂ  URL of the item. Instances of StatisticalPopulation may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description observedNode ObservationÂ  The observedNode of an Observation, often a StatisticalPopulation.
