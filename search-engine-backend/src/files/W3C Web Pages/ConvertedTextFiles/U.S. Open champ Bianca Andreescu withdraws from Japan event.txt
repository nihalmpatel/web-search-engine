The 19-year-old Canadian didn’t divulge when the injury occurred. She rolled through Serena Williams last Saturday to claim her first Grand Slam title. “I’m sorry to have to miss The Toray Pan Pacific Open this year,” the World No. 5 said on the WTA website. “I know it’s the biggest women’s tennis event in Japan and one that I look forward to playing in the future. Hope to see you all soon!” Belinda Bencic (left foot) of Switzerland and Marketa Vondrousova (left wrist) of the Czech Republic also pulled out with injuries. Bencic lost to Andreescu in the U.S. Open semifinals. “I am sad not to be able to come to Osaka this year and play in the Toray Pan Pacific Open,” Bencic said. “I always love playing in Japan and especially in front of the passionate fans, but I need to give my foot some rest before I start the Asia swing. I am looking forward to coming back to Japan next year and wish the tournament all the best for this year’s edition.” Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic is the defending champion. She beat Japan’s Naomi Osaka in last year’s final.
