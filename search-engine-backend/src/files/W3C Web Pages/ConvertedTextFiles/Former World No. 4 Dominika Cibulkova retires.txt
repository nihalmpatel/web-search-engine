Cibulkova became the first Slovak woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final in 2014, when she lost to China’s Li Na in the Australian Open title match. Cibulkova won eight singles crowns and she reached her career-best ranking in March 2017. The two-time Olympian (2008, 2012) last played a WTA match in May when she lost to Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus in the first round of the French Open. She struggled with an Achilles injury over the past six months. “I was already feeling like the tennis life is really tough, with all the traveling and training, giving 100 percent every day,” Cibulkova told WTA.com. “I was started to get tired of it. In the end, I felt like I gave enough and achieved things I never dreamed of reaching in my career.” Cibulkova compiled a 450-299 singles record and earned US$13,725,520 in prize money. –Field Level Media Andreescu first Canuck to win Rogers Cup since Windsor's Faye Urban This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
