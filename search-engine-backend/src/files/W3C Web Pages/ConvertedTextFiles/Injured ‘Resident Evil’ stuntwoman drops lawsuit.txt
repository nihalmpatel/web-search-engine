Olivia Jackson was working as the actress‚Äô stunt double on 2016‚Äôs Resident Evil: The Final Chapter when an action scene went awry after Milla‚Äôs director husband, Paul W.S. Anderson, allegedly changed the schedule at the last minute due to rain. After a motorcycle accident, her left arm was amputated above the elbow and she also suffered lasting nerve damage and facial scarring, and Jackson filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles in September, alleging Anderson and his producing partner Jeremy Bolt, were responsible.

It means the world to me!¬† Now‚Äôs the time we need to stand together to fight against film productions that run haphazardly organised sets, aren‚Äôt fully insured & leave their injured (or killed) crew members abandoned while they look the other way.¬† I‚Äôm joining the @crewmatter movement to shine a light on these situations so that it never happens to anyone else again.

(Swipe right to see what‚Äôs what) It‚Äôs taken 4 shoulder surgeries to try untwist everything and keep it all in position but I‚Äôd be lost without such an amazing surgeon!

However, the dismissal may not mean the filmmakers are off the hook ‚Äì as she is still able to sue in other jurisdictions. In their own motion to dismiss, the defendants argued that Jackson‚Äôs stunt performer contract includes a provision requiring disputes are resolved in South Africa, where the zombie movie was filmed.

She claimed she also sustained injuries to her spine, eye socket, and ribs, and will never be able to work as a stuntwoman again. Lil Nas X pulls out of Billy Ray Cyrus show at...
