(Christian Petersen/Getty Images) Share Adjust Comment Print Rob Gronkowski still has football on his mind, but the retired All-Pro tight end has no immediate plans to get back in the game. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äònever coming back,‚Äô‚Äù Gronkowski said Tuesday in an announcement he teased earlier via social media. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 30 years old. I‚Äôm young. I still stay fit, still watch the game whenever I can, still enjoy it. I‚Äôm feeling good, but you know, one year off could possibly be the case. Or maybe two years off, man. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always an option in the back of my head. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not staying in shape and not doing anything. I‚Äôm never stressed over it.‚Äù I'm bringing the FIESTA üéâ to Miami with GRONK BEACH BIG GAME WEEKEND presented by @MonsterEnergy!

Gronkowski would need to file the appropriate paperwork by Nov. 30 to play this season, and he reiterated Tuesday ‚Äî while formally announcing his Super Bowl party plans in Florida ‚Äî that football isn‚Äôt a priority at the moment. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs better, me playing or me hitting this party?‚Äù Gronkowski chuckled. Gronkowski said the beach music festival would be the place to be Super Bowl week.
