Regina Leader-Post Updated: November 22, 2019 Share Adjust Comment Print Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo is the runner-up for the CFL’s most-outstanding-player award. Brandon Banks of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats claimed the league’s most-coveted individual prize Thursday night in Calgary, receiving 41 of 50 first-place votes. In 16 regular-season games, Banks caught 112 passes for 1,550 yards and 13 touchdowns. He also rushed for a TD and scored twice on missed field goal returns. Cody Fajardo of the Roughriders is the runner-up for the CFL’s most-outstanding-player award. Troy Fleece / Regina Leader-Post As a first-year starter, Fajardo threw for 4,302 yards (the most in the league) and 18 touchdowns while helping Saskatchewan post a 13-5 record and finish first in the West Division. He also rushed 611 yards and 10 touchdowns. Riders linebacker Cameron Judge is the runner-up for the CFL’s most outstanding Canadian award. Brandon Harder / Regina Leader-Post Two other members of the Roughriders — Cameron Judge and Craig Dickenson — were also runners-up on Thursday. Judge was up for the most-outstanding-Canadian award, won by Montreal Alouettes linebacker Henoc Muamba. Muamba, who was a member of the Roughriders in 2016 and 2017, had 93 defensive tackles and one sack this past season. He received 34 first-place votes. Muamba thanked the Roughriders “for allowing me to play and grow in this league.” Judge had 61 defensive tackles, five sacks and two interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He added 11 special-teams tackles. Saskatchewan’s Craig Dickenson is the runner-up for CFL coach-of-the-year honours. Brandon Harder / Regina Leader-Post Dickenson was the runner-up for coach-of-the-year. Orlondo Steinauer of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats received the award after guiding his team to a 15-3 record and a berth in Sunday’s Grey Cup game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. “Craig Dickenson, you could be up here very easily,” Steinauer, who received 38 first-place votes, said after receiving his award. “Congratulations to you.” Dickenson extended congratulations in return. “Coach O is very well-deserving of the award,” Dickenson told CKRM’s Derek Taylor. “I was disappointed our guys didn’t get them, but it doesn’t mean they were any less successful or had any less of a great season. “I think we had a great season all around and I was proud of the guys, regardless of whether any awards came up.” Ex-Roughrider Willie Jefferson, now of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, was named the most outstanding defensive player. He received 39 first-place votes. Hamilton’s Simoni Lawrence was the runner-up. Also honoured were Hamilton teammates Chris Van Zeyl (most outstanding offensive lineman) and Frankie Williams (top special-teams player), along with Calgary Stampeders linebacker Nate Holley (rookie of the year). Jim Lawson, chairman of the CFL’s board of governors, received the Commissioner’s Award. Stampeders general manager and president John Hufnagel received the Hugh Campbell Distinguished Leadership Award. The Tom Pate Memorial Award was presented to Stampeders punter Rob Maver, in recognition of his sportsmanship and contributions to the team and his community. Montreal long-snapper Martin Bedard received the Jake Gaudaur Veterans’ Award. The Stampeders’ director of video operations, Ross Folan, was the inaugural winner of the Jane Mawby Tribute Award, which honours an often-unsung employee at the club or league level.   Fajardo not taking the Bombers, without Harris and Nichols, for granted This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
