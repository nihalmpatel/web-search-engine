The town’s council voted Monday to allow secondary dwellings in single detached houses, semi-detached houses, row houses and accessory structures, like garages — or tiny houses. They must be a minimum of 30 square metres or 323 square feet, built on a foundation and be located within 20 metres of the primary dwelling, in the side or back yards. They must also follow Ontario’s building and fire codes, which govern the size of rooms, doors and windows, water and sewer services, heating, cooling and ventilation. Tiny houses will be allowed only as secondary dwellings now, because the minimum size for a primary residence in the town is 55 square metres. But, said Mayor Aldo DiCarlo, “it really opens the door to what you can do in the Town of Amherstburg.” Amherstburg Mayor Aldo DiCarlo at a special meeting of town council on April 2, 2019. Taylor Campbell / Windsor Star A group of students from Stella Maris Catholic School urged council last month to pass a bylaw allowing tiny houses, arguing they are more affordable and more sustainable. “It was very well-received,” DiCarlo said of the students’ presentation, “especially from seniors who want to stay in a dwelling by themselves, from young people starting out or people who have no interest in starting a family. “I think it’s something we should probably look into.” Secondary units are self-contained residential units within the main home or an ancillary structure. They include a private kitchen, bathroom and sleeping area. They must be smaller than the main house and maintain the character of the primary residence. They can not be in the basement of a house that’s in a flood plain. No additional driveways will be allowed, and one extra parking space must be provided. ajarvis@postmedia.com  Gallery: Holiday tours of Willistead Manor to begin Dec. 1 Public board teachers go work-to-rule This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
