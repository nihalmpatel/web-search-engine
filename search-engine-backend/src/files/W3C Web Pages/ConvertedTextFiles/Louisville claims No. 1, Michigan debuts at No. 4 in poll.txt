Kevin Jairaj / USA TODAY Sports Share Adjust Comment Print Undefeated Louisville became the fourth team already this season to occupy the No. 1 spot in the men’s college basketball AP Top 25 poll, released Monday. Duke, which held the No. 1 ranking a week ago, plummeted to No. 10 after its stunning 85-83 overtime loss to Stephen F. Austin last Tuesday. Michigan moved from the ranks of the unranked all the way to No. 4 on the strength of its victory in the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas, beating Top 10 teams North Carolina and Gonzaga in consecutive games. Louisville (7-0) is followed by Kansas (6-1), Maryland (8-0), Michigan (7-0) and Virginia (7-0). The Cardinals captured 48 of the 65 first-place votes, with the Jayhawks (three), Wolverines (nine) and Cavaliers (five) also receiving votes. Moving into the No. 6 spot is Ohio State (7-0), followed by North Carolina (6-1), Kentucky (6-1), Gonzaga (8-1) and Duke (7-1). The Tar Heels and Bulldogs both fell a spot after their losses to Michigan. Michigan State (5-2), the preseason No. 1, fell from No. 3 to No. 11. While the Spartans beat both Georgia and UCLA during the past week, they also lost to unranked Virginia Tech, 71-66. Utah State, No. 15 last week, dropped 10 spots after an 81-73 loss to Saint Mary’s. Moving into the Top 25 were Florida State (7-1) at No. 17, Dayton (5-1) at No. 19 and Butler (7-0) at No. 24. Falling out were Texas Tech (5-2), which was No. 12 last week but lost to Iowa and Creighton, along with VCU, Florida and Xavier. –Field Level Media –Field Level Media No. 2 Michigan State beats Wisconsin, wraps up Big Ten title This Week's Flyers Comments Postmedia is pleased to bring you a new commenting experience.
